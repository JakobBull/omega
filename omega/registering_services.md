# Registering Services

Today's problem. We want to register a service in the decentralized network.

Why?

This is used as a decentralized authentification that matches a service to a public key. So only if the public key is matched is a service returned. We can also get information about the service, such as normal login url, security status etc with potential warnings.

E.g. 

0x1F349EA8B170

ok

This is good.
